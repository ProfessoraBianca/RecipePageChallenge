## My process

> In this project I tried to use the PerfectPixel extension for Chrome.
> It helped a lot but I still have to train using it.

 I started by layering all the HTML content, text and containers for the images.

 Then I went to CSS and added the background color for the `<body>` and other future elements by using color variables, so it would be easier to use after. I also added the necessary fonts path.

 And so... It was **HELL**.

><sup> 1. Famous brazilian expression</sup>

I had a lot of problems with this design. 
<sup><sup> (as you can probably see in the .CSS file) </sup></sup>
 
 At first, what appeared to be simple was a hell of a challenge. Like the **lists**: 
 

 - I wasn't capable of making the wraped text to align with the begining of the paragraph.
 - I had difficulty adjusting the line height of the text vs the list + list gap. 
 <sup><sup>(but I learned how to do it... maybe?!)</sup></sup>
 - The alignment of the markers <sub><sub> (and color of it) </sub></sub> vs text was a very hard thing too.. I did make it but maybe it isn't the best way of doing.
  

> Note: I didn't used some colors offered by Frontend Mentor... Was it my
> fault or there where more colors than needed?
